# Before and After Examples
This section demonstrates the practical impact of the system by comparing captions generated without structured prompt guidance against captions generated using a professional tone suitable for linkedin

The examples reflect a realistic usage scenario where a user upload an image and requests a professional caption for a professional networking platform 

## Use case
- User uploads an image 
- User selects the tone : Professional 
- The system generates a linked appropriate Caption 

Example - Generic caption vs Professional linkedin caption 

### Before ( No structured prompt vs Tone guidance) 
Caption : A photo from today

### After ( Professional Tone for linkedin )
Caption : Feeling grateful for the opportunity to contribute and collaborate. Every day is a chance to learn and grow 

### Observations 
The professional tone results in clearer intent and purpose 
- Captions are more suitable for a professional audience 
- Language aligns with Linkedin communication norms
- The output feels intentional rather than generic

## Practical Impact
This comparison highlights how structured prompt design and tone selection significantly improve the usefulness of generated captions in real world professional contexts 

## Note
The examples show represent typical system behaviour and are intended to illustrate qualitative improvements rather than best case or curated outputs
