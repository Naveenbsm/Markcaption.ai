# Hashtags relevance analysis 

## Objective 
This experiment focuses on evaluating the relevance and usefulness of hashtags generated alongside captions

Relevant hashtags improve content discoverability, while irrelevant or overly generic hashtags reduce value for users

## Evaluation Criteria 
Hashtags were assessed based on :
- Relevance to the image content 
- Alignment with the generated caption
- Practical usefulness on social platforms
- Avoidance of misleading or spam like tags 

## Experimental Approach 
Generated hashtags were reviewed manually and compared against the visual content of the image and the caption text 

Hashtags were grouped into
- Highly relevant 
- Moderately relevant 
- Irrelevant or generic 

## Observations 
- Context aware prompts produced more specific hashtags 
- Overly broad prompts led to generic tags
- Limiting the number of hashtags improved overall quality 

## Challenges 
- Hashtag relevance is highly subjective 
- Platform trends change over time
- No universal definition of a good hashtags

## Summary 
Manual analysis showed that guiding the generation process with context and light constraints significantly improved hashtag relevance. This reinforced the importance of prompt design and qualitative evaluation in generative systems
