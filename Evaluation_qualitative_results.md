# Qualitative Evaluation Results 
## Evaluation Approach 
The system was evaluated using a qualitative, user centric approach focused on real world usability rather than automated metrics 

This approach reflects how caption quality is typically judged in practical social media contexts

## Evaluation Criteria 
Generated outputs were assessed based on
- Relevance to the uploaded image 
- Clarity and readability
- Alignment with selected tone or style
- Suitability for social media usage 

Evaluations were performed manually by reviewing generated results across multiple test cases

## Key findings 
- Captions were generally aligned with image context
- Tone selection improved perceived quality and engagement 
- Outputs were concise and readable
- Hashtags supported discoverability without overwhelming the caption 

## Consistency 
The system produced consistent outputs across different images and tone selections, indicating stable prompt behaviour and reliable backend processing.

## limitations 
- Evaluation is subjective and not statistically measured 
- Sample size is limited 
- Results may vary depending on external model updates

## Summary 
The qualitative evaluation confirmed that the system meets its design goals. The outputs are practical, relevant and suitable for real world use, validating the effectiveness of the prompt design and system architecture
