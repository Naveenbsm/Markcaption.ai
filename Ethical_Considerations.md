# Ethical Considerations 
## Responsible Use of Generative AI
The system is designed to support creative expression rather than replace human judgement. Generated outputs are intended to assist users who remain responsible for how content is used and shared 

## Bias and Limitations
Generative models may reflect biases present in their training data. The system does not attempt to make factual claims and avoids generating sensitive or harmful content 

## Transparency 
The application communicates clearly that captions are AI generated. Users are not misled into believing outputs are human authored

## Content Safety 
The system avoids generating explicit, harmful or misleading content by limiting scope and maintaining conservative prompt design 

## Accountability 
Design decisions are documented within this repository to provide transparency into how the system operates and how Ethical considerations were addressed 

## Summary 
Ethical considerations informed system design Choices throughout development. The project demonstrates awareness of the broader implications of deploying generative AI responsibly
